It is a platform\nthat every programmer uses in their workflow. With over 4 million registeres users, the platform caters exchange of over 10 million questions in a year. To make things easy to understand, the platform automatically tag each question based on the topic. Based on the type of tags, some of the most used tags are: java, python, javascript, etc. \n\n**Problem statement** <br>\nAnalyse the information in the question title and body to assign tags to new questions in the future.\n\n**Business value** <br>\nIt is job of the platform to route the right question to right users. E.g. you don't want to be sending a java related question to javascript developer. That would be a huge miss and will affect the user experience of the platform. Stackoverflow can make use of topic information about a question to forward it to the subject matter expert. This is why the problem of predicting tags is of high value to ensure a good user experience. \n    ","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-03-13T10:22:06.278420Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-03-13T10:22:06.279495Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-03-13T10:22:07.046140Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-03-13T10:22:06.279429Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-03-13T10:22:07.044567Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":6,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"/bin/bash: linux: command not found\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
