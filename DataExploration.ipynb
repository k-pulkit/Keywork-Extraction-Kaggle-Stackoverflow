This is why the problem of predicting tags is of high value to ensure a good user experience. \n","    "]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":12,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2022-03-13T10:22:06.279495Z","iopub.status.busy":"2022-03-13T10:22:06.278420Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-03-13T10:22:07.046140Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-03-13T10:22:07.044567Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-03-13T10:22:06.279429Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[{"ename":"KeyboardInterrupt","evalue":"","output_type":"error","traceback":["\u001b[0;31m---------------------------------------------------------------------------\u001b[0m","\u001b[0;31mKeyboardInterrupt\u001b[0m                         Traceback (most recent call last)","\u001b[0;32m<ipython-input-12-b4b25a2e381c>\u001b[0m in \u001b[0;36m<module>\u001b[0;34m()\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32m      4\u001b[0m \u001b[0;32mfor\u001b[0m \u001b[0mi\u001b[0m \u001b[0;32min\u001b[0m \u001b[0mrange\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m(\u001b[0m\u001b[0;36m100000\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m)\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m:\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32m      5\u001b[0m     \u001b[0mx\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m.\u001b[0m\u001b[0mappend\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m(\u001b[0m\u001b[0mi\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m)\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0;32m----> 6\u001b[0;31m     \u001b[0mtime\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m.\u001b[0m\u001b[0msleep\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m(\u001b[0m\u001b[0;36m0.05\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m)\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m","\u001b[0;31mKeyboardInterrupt\u001b[0m: "]}],"source":["import time\n","\n","x = []\n","for i in range(100000):\n","    x.append(i)\n","    time.sleep(0.05)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":8,"metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["1\n"]}],"source":["print(1)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.7.12"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
